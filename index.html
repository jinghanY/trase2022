    <h4>What is this workshop?</h4>
    <p>
        This is the official website of the 2nd International (Virtual) Workshop on Autonomous Agents for Social Good (AASG) 2021, which is co-located with the <a href="https://aamas2021.soton.ac.uk/">20th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) 2021.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The n a responsible manner for the benefit of humanity (i.e., for social good). To achieve this goal, a wide range of perspectives and contributions are needed, spanning the full spectrum from fundamental research to sustained deployments in the real-world.
    </p>
    <p>
         This workshop explores how MAS research can contribute to solving challenging problems faced by current-day societies. For example, what role can MAS research play in promoting health and sustainable development? What role can it play in tackling the impact of a rapidly changing climate? What do MAS techniques have to offer to the field of infrastructure security? How can MAS initiatives be used to achieve consensus among a set of negotiating self-interested entities (e.g., finding resolutions to trade talks between countries)? To address such questions, this workshop brings together researchers and practitioners across different strands of MAS research and a wide range of important real-world application domains. The objective is to share the current state of research and practice, explore directions for future work, and create opportunities for collaboration. In addition, the workshop places a special emphasis on highlighting MAS approaches for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. Clearly, MAS research has an important role to play in providing unique insights about the COVID-19 pandemic and developing targeted responses; we encourage submissions from both MAS researchers as well as epidemiologists, health policy researchers, and other domain experts who are interested in engaging with the AAMAS community.
